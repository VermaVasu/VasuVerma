								<p>
									Hi! I’m Vasu Verma and I am passionately curious. I hail from India; 
									a land not only rich in its history & tradition but also in its pool of scientists and engineers. 
								</p>
								<p>
									My enthusiasm for the unlimited scope of electronics began, ever since I made my first Solar
									Powered RC Bot in High School and watched all the small components come together with such intricacy.
								</p>
								<p>
									My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering 
									from the National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. Electronics engineering is an intricate, 
									multidisciplinary never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe that with the right combination of programming and circuitry tinkering we can improve the lives of people around the world. So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. 
									There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
								<h3>Debug HSSI between DLP controller and DMD</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Worked on debugging of <b>Texas Instruments</b> Proprietary High speed HSSI signals(3.2GHz) flowing between the DLP(Digital Light Processing) Controller and the DMD(Digital Micromirror Device). 
									Characterization of the signal by providing an eye diagram by solely running python scripts on the Display Controller Software and Embedded C functionalities on the circuit board.
									Eliminated the use of oscilloscopes to plot an eye diagram while simultaneously providing a solution to improve the signal for the consumers.

                                				<h3>ARDUINO BASED LI-FI PROTOTYPE </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lifi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									LiFi is a fundamental 5G technology. With claims to be 100 times faster and theoretical speed limit of 100Gbps, this technology will clearly unlock the IoT and drive Industry 4.0 applications.
									Did a college funded project on ways to improve the speed of data transmission using modulation schemes on MATLAB and indigenously developed Li-Fi based transceivers.

								<h3>Exploring biomarkers for early detection of COVID</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img style="height: 420px;" src="images/op.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Data analysis on Patient’s Sp02 measurements found using Pulse Oximetry. Studied it’s direct relation for detecting early onset
									of COVID Pneumonia to assist in time quarantining and hospitalization of at risk individuals.</p>
								<hr>
								<h3>BOLT IOT AND ML PROJECTS </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bolt.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Worked on Bolt IoT platform based several projects implemented by  C++, Python and APIs - Polyfit and Z-Score. Helped me gain knowledge about integration of several devices using IoT and ML.
									Did various projects regarding implementation of the same. A list of projects includes Home Automation, Voice Controlled Lighting, Environmental Monitoring, Smart Farming, etc.

								<h3>Optimization of 2 stage operational amplifier </h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Designed a Two stage single ended output Differential Amplifier (differential + Gain stage) with power dissipation less than 200nW. The main features 
									achieved through the design were Slew Rate greater than 10V/uS and Gain Bandwidth = 5MHz using LTSpice tools
